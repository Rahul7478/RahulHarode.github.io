I am an aspiring Data Analyst with an academic background in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science and hands-on experience in data analytics through projects and internships. I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable business insights using Python, SQL, Advanced Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.

My portfolio includes projects such as job market and salary prediction, sales forecasting, fitness performance dashboards, and food waste reduction analysis, where I applied data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques to solve real-world business problems. These projects helped improve decision-making, optimize operations, reduce costs, and enhance profitability.

I have experience working with large datasets, building interactive dashboards, identifying trends and patterns, and communicating insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am passionate about data-driven problem solving, continuous learning, and leveraging analytics to create measurable business impact.

I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst or Data Analytics Intern where I can contribute analytical skills, business understanding, and a strong willingness to grow.
